# Detections

Welcome to the Detections repository! This repository houses various KQL-based detections designed to help identify security threats in your environment.

## Future Plans
I am working on enhancing the repository by introducing documentation based on the Palantir Alerting and Detection Strategy Framework to provide a more structured approach. Stay tuned for updates as the repository evolves.

## Stay Updated
This repository will be updated as new detections are created or when external datasets are updated. Make sure to watch the repo for the latest changes!
