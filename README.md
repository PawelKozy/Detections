# Detections

Welcome to the Detections repository! This repository houses various KQL-based detections designed to help identify security threats in your environment.

## Future Plans
I am working on enhancing the repository by introducing documentation based on the Palantir Alerting and Detection Strategy Framework to provide a more structured approach. Stay tuned for updates as the repository evolves.

## Stay Updated
This repository will be updated with new detections and improvements as time permits. Be sure to watch the repository to stay up-to-date with the latest changes!
